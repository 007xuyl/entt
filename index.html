<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
Introduction</h1>
<p><code>EnTT</code> is a header-only, tiny and easy to use framework written in modern C++.<br />
 It was originally designed entirely around an architectural pattern called <em>ECS</em> that is used mostly in game development. For further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/">Entity Systems Wiki</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/">Evolve Your Hierarchy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system">ECS on Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A long time ago, the sole entity-component system was part of the project. After a while the codebase has grown and more and more classes have become part of the repository.<br />
 That's why today it's called <em>the EnTT Framework</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
The framework</h2>
<p><code>EnTT</code> was written initially as a faster alternative to other well known and open source entity-component systems. Nowadays the <code>EnTT</code> framework is moving its first steps. Much more will come in the future and hopefully I'm going to work on it for a long time.<br />
 Requests for feature, PR, suggestions ad feedback are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>If you find you can help me and want to contribute to the <code>EnTT</code> framework with your experience or you do want to get part of the project for some other reason, feel free to contact me directly (you can find the mail in the <a href="https://github.com/skypjack">profile</a>).<br />
 I can't promise that each and every contribution will be accepted, but I can assure that I'll do my best to take them all seriously.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
State of the art</h3>
<p>Here is a brief list of what it offers today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statically generated integer identifiers for types (assigned either at compile-time or at runtime).</li>
<li>An incredibly fast entity-component system based on sparse sets, with its own views and a <em>pay for what you use</em> policy to adjust performance and memory pressure according to the users' requirements.</li>
<li>Signal handlers of any type, delegates and an event bus.</li>
<li>A general purpose event emitter, that is a CRTP idiom based class template.</li>
<li>An event dispatcher for immediate and delayed events to integrate in loops.</li>
<li>The smallest and most basic implementation of a service locator ever seen.</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>Any other business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider it a work in progress. For more details and an updated list, please refer to the <a href="https://skypjack.github.io/entt/">online documentation</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
A note about the README</h3>
<p>The README file stays true to the original project and it describes only the entity-component system. However, the whole API is fully documented in-code and the <a href="https://skypjack.github.io/entt/">online documentation</a> contains much more.<br />
 Continue reading to know how the core part of the project works or follow the link above to take a look at the API reference for all other available classes.</p>

Motivation</h2>
<p>I started working on <code>EnTT</code> because of the wrong reason: my goal was to design an entity-component system that beated another well known open source solution in terms of performance.<br />
 I did it, of course, but it wasn't much satisfying. Actually it wasn't satisfying at all. The fastest and nothing more, fairly little indeed. When I realized it, I tried hard to keep intact the great performance of <code>EnTT</code> and to add all the features I wanted to see in <em>my</em> entity-component system at the same time.</p>
<p>Today <code>EnTT</code> is finally what I was looking for: still faster than its <em>competitors</em>, a really good API and an amazing set of features. And even more, of course.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Performance</h2>
<p>As it stands right now, <code>EnTT</code> is just fast enough for my requirements if compared to my first choice (that was already amazingly fast indeed).<br />
 Here is a comparision between the two (both of them compiled with GCC 7.2.0 on a Dell XPS 13 out of the mid 2014):</p>

<p><code>EnTT</code> includes its own tests and benchmarks. See <a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt/blob/master/test/benchmark.cpp">benchmark.cpp</a> for further details.<br />
 On Github users can find also a <a href="https://github.com/abeimler/ecs_benchmark">benchmark suite</a> that compares a bunch of different projects, one of which is <code>EnTT</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, probably I'll try to get out of <code>EnTT</code> more features and better performance in the future, mainly for fun.<br />
 If you want to contribute and/or have any suggestion, feel free to make a PR or open an issue to discuss your idea.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Build Instructions</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
Requirements</h2>
<p>To be able to use <code>EnTT</code>, users must provide a full-featured compiler that supports at least C++14.<br />
 The requirements below are mandatory to compile the tests and to extract the documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>CMake version 3.2 or later.</li>
<li>Doxygen version 1.8 or later.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Library</h2>
<p><code>EnTT</code> is a header-only library. This means that including the <code><a class="el" href="entt_8hpp_source.html">entt.hpp</a></code> header is enough to include the whole framework and use it. For those who are interested only in the entity-component system, consider to include the sole <code><a class="el" href="registry_8hpp_source.html">entity/registry.hpp</a></code> header instead.<br />
 It's a matter of adding the following line to the top of a file:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#include &lt;entt/entt.hpp&gt;</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Use the line below to include only the entity-component system instead:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#include &lt;entt/entity/registry.hpp&gt;</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Then pass the proper <code>-I</code> argument to the compiler to add the <code>src</code> directory to the include paths.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
Documentation</h2>
<p>The documentation is based on <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">doxygen</a>. To build it: </p><pre class="fragment">$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make docs
</pre><p>The API reference will be created in HTML format within the directory <code>build/docs/html</code>. To navigate it with your favorite browser: </p><pre class="fragment">$ cd build
$ your_favorite_browser docs/html/index.html
</pre><p>The API reference is also available <a href="https://skypjack.github.io/entt/">online</a> for the latest version.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
Tests</h2>
<p>To compile and run the tests, <code>EnTT</code> requires <em>googletest</em>.<br />
 <code>cmake</code> will download and compile the library before to compile anything else.</p>
<p>To build the tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$ cd build</code></li>
<li><code>$ cmake ..</code></li>
<li><code>$ make</code></li>
<li><code>$ make test</code></li>
</ul>
<p>To build the benchmarks, use the following line instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Benchmarks are compiled only in release mode currently.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
Crash Course</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
Design choices</h2>
<p><code>EnTT</code> is entirely designed around the principle that users have to pay only for what they want.</p>
<p>When it comes to use an entity-componet system, the tradeoff is usually between performance and memory usage. The faster it is, the more memory it uses. However, slightly worse performance along non-critical paths are the right price to pay to reduce memory usage and I've always wondered why this kind of tools do not leave me the choice.<br />
 <code>EnTT</code> follows a completely different approach. It squezees the best from the basic data structures and gives users the possibility to pay more for higher performance where needed.<br />
 The disadvantage of this approach is that users need to know the systems they are working on and the tools they are using. Otherwise, the risk to ruin the performance along critical paths is high.</p>
<p>So far, this choice has proved to be a good one and I really hope it can be for many others besides me.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md15"></a>
Vademecum</h2>
<p>The <code>Registry</code> to store, the <code>View</code>s to iterate. That's all.</p>
<p>An entity (the <em>E</em> of an <em>ECS</em>) is an opaque identifier that users should just use as-is and store around if needed. Do not try to inspect an entity identifier, its type can change in future and a registry offers all the functionalities to query them out-of-the-box. The underlying type of an entity (either <code>std::uint16_t</code>, <code>std::uint32_t</code> or <code>std::uint64_t</code>) can be specified when defining a registry (actually the DefaultRegistry is nothing more than a Registry where the type of the entities is <code>std::uint32_t</code>).<br />
 Components (the <em>C</em> of an <em>ECS</em>) should be plain old data structures or more complex and moveable data structures with a proper constructor. Actually, the sole requirement of a component type is that it must be both move constructible and move assignable. They are list initialized by using the parameters provided to construct the component itself. No need to register components or their types neither with the registry nor with the entity-component system at all.<br />
 Systems (the <em>S</em> of an <em>ECS</em>) are just plain functions, functors, lambdas or whatever the users want. They can accept a Registry, a View or a PersistentView and use them the way they prefer. No need to register systems or their types neither with the registry nor with the entity-component system at all.</p>
<p>The following sections will explain in short how to use the entity-component system, the core part of the whole framework.<br />
 In fact, the framework is composed of many other classes in addition to those describe below. For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://skypjack.github.io/entt/">online documentation</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
The Registry, the Entity and the Component</h2>
<p>A registry is used to store and manage entities as well as to create views to iterate the underlying data structures.<br />
 Registry is a class template that lets the users decide what's the preferred type to represent an entity. Because <code>std::uint32_t</code> is large enough for almost all the cases, there exists also an alias named DefaultRegistry for <code>Registry&lt;std::uint32_t&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Entities are represented by <em>entitiy identifiers</em>. An entity identifier is an opaque type that users should not inspect or modify in any way. It carries information about the entity itself and its version.</p>
<p>A registry can be used both to construct and to destroy entities:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// constructs a naked entity with no components ad returns its identifier</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> entity = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a68363417c654ab36e68606c13deb850e">create</a>();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// constructs an entity and assigns it default-initialized components</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> another = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a68363417c654ab36e68606c13deb850e">create</a>&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// destroys an entity and all its components</span></div><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#afe1fc933ce101207a49b6bdeafa2ce41">destroy</a>(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Once an entity is deleted, the registry can freely reuse it internally with a slightly different identifier. In particular, the version of an entity is increased each and every time it's destroyed.<br />
 In case entity identifiers are stored around, the registry offers all the functionalities required to test them and get out of the them all the information they carry:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// returns true if the entity is still valid, false otherwise</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">bool</span> b = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a11a759638bf2c28ac1670c7b533ca53f">valid</a>(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// gets the version contained in the entity identifier</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> version = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a773c2bb361f4e83aae1349ccfeede56b">version</a>(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// gets the actual version for the given entity</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> curr = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#a4e1a07f4170764925864b162277485b6">current</a>(entity);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Components can be assigned to or removed from entities at any time with a few calls to member functions of the registry. As for the entities, the registry offers also a set of functionalities users can use to work with the components.</p>
<p>The <code>assign</code> member function template creates, initializes and assigns to an entity the given component. It accepts a variable number of arguments that are used to construct the component itself if present:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aa6b578d40a9305869e692167fc3dcddf">assign</a>&lt;Position&gt;(entity, 0., 0.);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;velocity = registry.<a class="code" href="classentt_1_1Registry.html#aa6b578d40a9305869e692167fc3dcddf">assign</a>&lt;Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">velocity.dx = 0.;</div><div class="line">velocity.dy = 0.;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>If the entity already has the given component, the <code>replace</code> member function template can be used to replace it:</p>

<ul>
<li>If no entity is passed to it, <code>reset</code> will remove the given component from each entity that has it:</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
Sorting: is it possible?</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that sorting entities and components is possible with <code>EnTT</code>.<br />
 In fact, there are two functions that respond to slightly different needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components can be sorted directly:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.sort&lt;Renderable&gt;([](<span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;lhs, <span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;rhs) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">return</span> lhs.z &lt; rhs.z;</div><div class="line">});</div></div><!-- fragment --><ul>
<li>Components can be sorted according to the order imposed by another component:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.sort&lt;Movement, Physics&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In this case, instances of <code>Movement</code> are arranged in memory so that cache misses are minimized when the two components are iterated together.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
View: to persist or not to persist?</h2>
<p>There are mainly two kinds of views: standard (also known as View) and persistent (alsa known as PersistentView).<br />
 Both of them have pros and cons to take in consideration. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Standard views:</p>
<p class="startli">Pros:</p><ul>
<li>They work out-of-the-box and don't require any dedicated data structure.</li>
<li>Creating and destroying them isn't expensive at all because they don't have any type of initialization.</li>
<li>They are the best tool to iterate single components.</li>
<li>They are the best tool to iterate multiple components at once when tags are involved or one of the component is assigned to a significantly low number of entities.</li>
<li>They don't affect any other operations of the registry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Cons:</p><ul>
<li>Their performance tend to degenerate when the number of components to iterate grows up and the most of the entities have all of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Persistent views:</p>
<p class="startli">Pros:</p><ul>
<li>Once prepared, creating and destroying them isn't expensive at all because they don't have any type of initialization.</li>
<li>They are the best tool to iterate multiple components at once when the most of the entities have all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Cons:</p><ul>
<li>They have dedicated data structures and thus affect the memory pressure to a minimal extent.</li>
<li>If not previously prepared, the first time they are used they go through an initialization step that could take a while.</li>
<li>They affect to a minimum the creation and destruction of entities and components. In other terms: the more persistent views there will be, the less performing will be creating and destroying entities and components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up and as a rule of thumb, use a standard view:</p><ul>
<li>To iterate entities for a single component.</li>
<li>To iterate entities for multiple components when a significantly low number of entities have one of the components.</li>
<li>In all those cases where a persistent view would give a boost to performance but the iteration isn't performed frequently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a persistent view in all the other cases.</p>
<p>To easily iterate entities, all the views offer the common <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> member functions that allow users to use a view in a typical range-for loop.<br />

<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
Standard View</h3>
<p>A standard view behaves differently if it's constructed for a single component or if it has been requested to iterate multiple components. Even the API is different in the two cases.<br />
 All that they share is the way they are created by means of a registry:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// single component standard view</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> single = registry.view&lt;Position&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// multi component standard view</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> multi = registry.view&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>For all that remains, it's worth discussing them separately.<br />
</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
Single component standard view</h4>
<p>Single component standard views are specialized in order to give a boost in terms of performance in all the situation. This kind of views can access the underlying data structures directly and avoid superflous checks.<br />
 They offer a bunch of functionalities to get the number of entities they are going to return and a raw access to the entity list as well as to the component list.<br />
 Refer to the <a href="https://skypjack.github.io/entt/">official documentation</a> for all the details.</p>
<p>There is no need to store views around for they are extremely cheap to construct, even though they can be copied without problems and reused freely. In fact, they return newly created and correctly initialized iterators whenever <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> are invoked.<br />
 To iterate a single component standard view, either use it in range-for loop:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.view&lt;Renderable&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">for</span>(<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity: view) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;renderable = view.get(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Or rely on the <code>each</code> member function to iterate entities and get all their components at once:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.view&lt;Renderable&gt;().each([](<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity, <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;renderable) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Performance are more or less the same. The best approach depends mainly on whether all the components have to be accessed or not.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: prefer the <code>get</code> member function of a view instead of the <code>get</code> member function template of a registry during iterations, if possible. However, keep in mind that it works only with the components of the view itself.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
Multi component standard view</h4>
<p>Multi component standard views iterate entities that have at least all the given components in their bags. During construction, these views look at the number of entities available for each component and pick up a reference to the smallest set of candidates in order to speed up iterations.<br />
 They offer fewer functionalities than their companion views for single component, the most important of which can be used to reset the view and refresh the reference to the set of candidate entities to iterate.<br />
 Refer to the <a href="https://skypjack.github.io/entt/">official documentation</a> for all the details.</p>
<p>There is no need to store views around for they are extremely cheap to construct, even though they can be copied without problems and reused freely. In fact, they return newly created and correctly initialized iterators whenever <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> are invoked.<br />

<p><b>Note</b>: prefer the <code>get</code> member function of a view instead of the <code>get</code> member function template of a registry during iterations, if possible. However, keep in mind that it works only with the components of the view itself.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
Persistent View</h3>
<p>A persistent view returns all the entities and only the entities that have at least the given components. Moreover, it's guaranteed that the entity list is thightly packed in memory for fast iterations.<br />
 In general, persistent views don't stay true to the order of any set of components unless users explicitly sort them.</p>
<p>Persistent views can be used only to iterate multiple components. Create them as it follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.persistent&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>There is no need to store views around for they are extremely cheap to construct, even though they can be copied without problems and reused freely. In fact, they return newly created and correctly initialized iterators whenever <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> are invoked.<br />
 That being said, persistent views perform an initialization step the very first time they are constructed and this could be quite costly. To avoid it, consider asking to the registry to <em>prepare</em> them when no entities have been created yet:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.prepare&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;();</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>If the registry is empty, preparation is extremely fast. Moreover the <code>prepare</code> member function template is idempotent. Feel free to invoke it even more than once: if the view has been alreadt prepared before, the function returns immediately and does nothing.</p>
<p>A persistent view offers a bunch of functionalities to get the number of entities it's going to return, a raw access to the entity list and the possibility to sort the underlying data structures according to the order of one of the components for which it has been constructed.<br />
 Refer to the <a href="https://skypjack.github.io/entt/">official documentation</a> for all the details.</p>
<p>To iterate a persistent view, either use it in range-for loop:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">auto</span> view = registry.persistent&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">for</span>(<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity: view) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;position = view.get&lt;Position&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;velocity = view.get&lt;Velocity&gt;(entity);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Or rely on the <code>each</code> member function to iterate entities and get all their components at once:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">registry.persistent&lt;Position, Velocity&gt;().each([](<span class="keyword">auto</span> entity, <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;position, <span class="keyword">auto</span> &amp;velocity) {</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">});</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Performance are more or less the same. The best approach depends mainly on whether all the components have to be accessed or not.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: prefer the <code>get</code> member function of a view instead of the <code>get</code> member function template of a registry during iterations, if possible. However, keep in mind that it works only with the components of the view itself.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Side notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Entity identifiers are numbers and nothing more. They are not classes and they have no member functions at all. As already mentioned, do no try to inspect or modify an entity descriptor in any way.</li>
<li>As shown in the examples above, the preferred way to get references to the components while iterating a view is by using the view itself. It's a faster alternative to the <code>get</code> member function template that is part of the API of the Registry. That's because the registry must ensure that a pool for the given component exists before to use it; on the other side, views force the construction of the pools for all their components and access them directly, thus avoiding all the checks.</li>
<li><p class="startli">Most of the <em>ECS</em> available out there have an annoying limitation (at least from my point of view): entities and components cannot be created and/or deleted during iterations.<br />
 <code>EnTT</code> partially solves the problem with a few limitations:</p><ul>
<li>Creating entities and components is allowed during iterations.</li>
<li>Deleting an entity or removing its components is allowed during iterations if it's the one currently returned by a view. For all the other entities, destroying them or removing their components isn't allowed and it can result in undefined behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Iterators are invalidated and the behaviour is undefined if an entity is modified or destroyed and it's not the one currently returned by the view.<br />
 To work around it, possible approaches are:</p><ul>
<li>Store aside the entities and the components to be removed and perform the operations at the end of the iteration.</li>
<li>Mark entities and components with a proper tag component that indicates they must be purged, then perform a second iteration to clean them up one by one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Views and thus their iterators aren't thread safe. Do no try to iterate a set of components and modify the same set concurrently.<br />
 That being said, as long as a thread iterates the entities that have the component <code>X</code> or assign and removes that component from a set of entities, another thread can safely do the same with components <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> and everything will work like a charm.<br />
 As an example, users can freely execute the rendering system and iterate the renderable entities while updating a physic component concurrently on a separate thread if needed.</li>
